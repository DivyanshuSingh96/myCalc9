# myCalc9

### An Amazing Yet Simple Python Library

This library is a very basic library which is used to perform simple calculations.

**For example -** 4 + 9 or 92 - 8, etc.

It is the package used for educational purpose only

It has a class which includes the following things:
    
class BasicMaths
    methods add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), divide(a, b), remainder(a, b)

To use this module the following code is required:

```
import myCalc9 as Calc

calculate = Calc.BasicMaths(10, 6)

addition = calculate.add()
print(addition)
```

The output would be:
```
16
```

Did you see how easily we've calculated the sum of the given two numbers.

You can also do this. You just have to understand working of the functions and classes.
If you want to calculate the difference of two numbers just replace the add() function with subtract() function and so for other also.

> Python is a very beautiful, easy and powerful language that anyone could understand.
> Mastering in Python is much easier than other languages.

I hope you've gained some knowledge from this module.
Since this is my first library so in the future i'll try to make amazing libraries which could be useful for everyone.
Till the time stay tuned, stay healthy and never stop coding.

# Requirements

1. Python version should be 3.0+.
2. pip should be updated to the latest version. To upgrade pip use `pip install --upgrade pip`.

# Class and Functions

1. Class used `BasicMaths`.
2. Functions are:
   * add()
   * subtract()
   * multiply()
   * divide()
   * remainder()
3. There are only two parameters in each function.
   For example - add(a, b).
   a and b are two parameters.

# Installation
